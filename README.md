# Evaluating NOx policy
 
This github repo accompanies the anaylsis performed for the publication: 
> Webster, L. et al. Evaluating the variability and consistency of NOx emission regulation between sectors. **Submitted for publication** 


## Overview 

If you wish to run this code for yourself, it is best to set up an R project and save this repository in that directory. The data and scripts required will then be available for use. 

### data

This folder contains all the data used in the analysis, as well as the collated dataset used to produce Figure 6 - `collated_dataset.csv`.

### scripts 

When running the code, running the script `initialisation_script.R` will run all the necessary scripts to produce the data outputs. The scripts within `NOx/` perform the analysis for each sector. 


### plots

The plots used in the paper are avaialble as `.png` format in the `plots` folder.
